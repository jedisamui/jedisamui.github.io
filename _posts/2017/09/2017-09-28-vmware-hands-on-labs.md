For the last three years, I have had the honor of being a VMware Lab Captain. What does this mean? Well, it means that I volunteer about 300-400 hours of my time to help write, develop, support, encourage, and assist event goers with taking a product focused lab at our VMworld, vFocus, and VMUG events.

For the last two years, I have been a captain creating the vRealize Automation (vRA) Challenge Lab (HOL-1890). It has been such a fun way to introduce common vRA problems that Cloud Administrators will come across and not only show them how to troubleshoot and identify them, but to show those same administrators how to resolve them. In my day job within Professional Services (PSO), I use this lab to supplement my vRA Knowledge Transfer.

Now that VMWorld 2017 has completed, our hardwork on those labs are now being released to the public. Over the next short minute, all 81 labs will be released for you to take on your own time (and at home!). For now, here's Round 1.
