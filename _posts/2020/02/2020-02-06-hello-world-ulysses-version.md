Hello World!

Something new. I’m trying something new and I’m not sure if I am going to like it, or not. I have downloaded the Ulysses writing app for my iPad - in hopes that it will encourage me to want to write more for my blog, micronauts.us. We shall see, if this takes off. If not, then I’m out $40 (as I paid for the yearly subscription). Worse case scenario..... I have a new note taking tool. :)
