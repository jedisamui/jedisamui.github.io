"And the nominees are...."

The results are in, and the vExpert Community has spoken. Micronauts has been added to the vExpert Community! Woohoo!

I would like to thank VMware, my mom, my children.... hehehehe....

Now that I am a member of this prestigious community, I will try and make more of an effort to keep up-to-date with my homelab journey -- as well as my PSO troubleshooting and discoveries. I hope that my insights and experiences will help you along your journey as well.
