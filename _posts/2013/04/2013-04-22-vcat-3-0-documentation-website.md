I've been working on spinning up a new vCloud 5.1 environment in my lab. During this install, I've had to reference a number of various websites for various differing issues. One document that was referenced a bunch was the vCat. While looking for it, I came across this website which lays out the document in a very easy to understand and searchable format.

If you do vCloud implementations, I would recommend bookmarking this site as a good reference tool.
