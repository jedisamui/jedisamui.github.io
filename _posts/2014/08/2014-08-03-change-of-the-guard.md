I'm excited to post this.

As of May 27, 2014, I am now an official employee of VMware!!

I know.... why has it taken me this long to post about it. Well, for one, I've been really busy. Between transitioning from the old job to all of the things you have to learn/do for the new one, plus going on new engagements and getting caught up to speed; there really hasn't been a lot of time to blog. Now that I'm settled in a little, I hope to change that.

Many of you may ask, 'What was wrong with VeriStor (my previous employer)?' The answer is nothing. VeriStor was and still is a great place to work for. I had a tremendously good time working there. I made lots of great friends, and look forward to visiting with them as much as I can. I equate my move to VMware using an analogy of a baseball player. I'm playing in the 'big leagues' now! :)

With this change, I will be privy to a lot of new and exciting information. However, the NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) is still there, and I still cannot talk about the new stuff or features coming out. (Just know that the future is going to be awesome!)
