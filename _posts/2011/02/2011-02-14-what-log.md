If you have been working with VMware for awhile, you have probably developed a good grasp on which logs to look at and where they may reside when troubleshooting an issue.

During a recent search to discover where a specific log file resides, I came across this very informative article from the "vmwarewolf". It provided me the information on where the log file was hiding. In addition to that piece of gold, the article had a summary on what kind of data each logfile contained. I've definitely bookmarked this info, as I have referenced it a couple of times in the last couple of months.
